# CMSC 202 - Project 3
This is my code from project 2 of the University of Maryland - Baltimore County's CMSC 202 class. I took this class in October of 2020. This project was completed then, and has not been updated since then. At this time I have no intent to update the project further, or make any changes to the project.

## Statement of Purpose
This project is being uploaded to provide students with an example of the concepts taught by the project. This is not meant to serve as a solution to any current projects, and any semblance of such is merely coincidental. This (and my other projects) are additionally posted here for posterity, and availability.

### Project Concepts
This project was likely designed to teach students the following concepts, and I feel that my sample does a good job of illustrating and demonstrating these concepts.
- C++ Memory Management
- C++ Object Oriented Design
- C++ File I/O
- C++ Basics

## DISCLAIMER
By this point this code should be pretty out of date (I hope they've updated the project by now). This code should serve solely as a demonstration of how to perform file I/O, as well as guidance on object oriented programming. This project is not meant to be complex, nor is it meant to be super pretty.  

When I wrote this, I did not fully understand the importance of commenting your code. Since then I have gotten MUCH better at making meaningful comments, and readable code. If you are looking at this project, please be patient with the spotty comments and disorganized code.

Finally, if you are in CMSC 202 (or have been assigned this project or one similar to it in a different class) **DO NOT COPY THIS!**  
If you do, your professor **WILL** fail you, and you **WILL** get in trouble for academic dishonesty. If you ignore this and get in trouble, **it is 100% on you**.

### Code Ownership
For this project there were some files provided by the professor, which I have included here. For the most part, they are instrumental to the codebase and as such have not been removed. I do not pretend to be the owner of these files, and the individual files have the author's commented at the top.

### Request Removal
If you are from the UMBC faculty or staff and would like to request the removal of this repository, please send me an email at nathanw2@umbc.edu. Until such time that I receive a request for removal, this repository will remain up and public.
